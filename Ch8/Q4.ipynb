    "### 4 (a) Do Exercise 40.8 in MacKay’s book (MacKay 2003). It is cited here as follows: Estimate in bits the total sensory experience that you have had in your life – visual information, auditory information, etc. Estimate how much information you have memorized. Estimate the information content of the works of Shakespeare. Compare these with the capacity of your brain assuming you have 1011 neurons each making 1000 synaptic connections and that the (information) capacity result for one neuron (two bits per connection) applies. Is your brain full yet?"
